* Diversifyers
** Confirmed
   - Puzzle design challenge: Make your game around, or inspired by a real world
     toy you have played with in your lifetime. (For more information, see here)
   - Use the Source, Luke: Use one or more open source tools, game engines or
     libraries in your game (and thank them in in the Technology Notes section
     on the submission page).
   - Mixed Media - Make a physical game that utilises computer code.
   - Under the Hood - Make some or all of the code visible in your game.
   - In a webpage - Your gameplay is hidden in a seemingly normal web page.
   - Happy Anniversary - Your game should incorporate 2018's theme
     (Transmission) as well as 2019's theme.

** Considering
   - Forgive and Fortify: Create a game that explores how forgiveness
     strengthens those who practice it. (Forgiveness kits in English, Spanish,
     Chinese and Arabic)
   - Language-Independence: Create a game that can be understood regardless of
     which language the player speaks
   - Celestial - An option to adjust game speed is included
   - Assetless - Create all visuals programmatically or in the scene editor, and
     avoid any importing of image files, sprite sheets, 3D models etc.
   - The Guide I was looking for - Your game has a supplementary guide, using a
     different medium than the game itself, that players must refer to to beat the game.
